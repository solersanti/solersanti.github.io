<p>THE EDENSPIEKERMANN </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Edenspiekermann</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>We don’t do good work.
Good work is not enough; we need to do great work.
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We invent new tools. </p>
<br>
<p> That may mean throwing out the old toolbox.
We need inspiration to inspire.
<br>Share your experiences, ideas, failures, successes.
Failure is part of the process.
We collaborate.
<br>Collaboration does not mean consensus.
We generate ideas.
Idea generation is not idea selection.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We like making stuff. </p>
<br>
<p>
Useful, beautiful, important things. We dare say no. Saying yes is often just laziness.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We like surprises. </p>
<br>
<p>We have to mistrust our own routines.
It’s your company, too.
If something can be done better, don’t wait for permission.</p>
