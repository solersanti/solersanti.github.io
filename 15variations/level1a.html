<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We don’t do good work. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Good work is not enough; we need to do great work.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We invent new tools. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  That may mean throwing out the old toolbox.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We need inspiration to inspire. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Share your experiences, ideas, failures, successes.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We tolerate failure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Failure is part of the process.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We collaborate. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Collaboration does not mean consensus.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We generate ideas. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idea generation is not idea selection.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We like making stuff. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Useful, beautiful, important things.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We dare say no. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saying yes is often just laziness.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We like surprises. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We have to mistrust our own routines.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It’s your company, too. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If something can be done better, don’t wait for permission.
