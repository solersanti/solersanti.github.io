<p>THE EDENSPIEKERMANN MANIFESTO
Edenspiekermann</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>We don’t do good work.
    Good work is not enough; we need to do great work.</li>
    <li> We invent new tools.
    That may mean throwing out the old toolbox.</li>
    <li>We need inspiration to inspire.
    Share your experiences, ideas, failures, successes.</li>
    <li>We tolerate failure.
    Failure is part of the process.</li>
    <li>We collaborate.
    Collaboration does not mean consensus.</li>
    <li>We generate ideas.
    Idea generation is not idea selection. </li>
    <li>We like making stuff.
    Useful, beautiful, important things.</li>
    <li>We dare say no.
    Saying yes is often just laziness.</li>
    <li>We like surprises.
    We have to mistrust our own routines.</li>

</ol>

<p>
It’s your company, too.
If something can be done better, don’t wait for permission.</p>
