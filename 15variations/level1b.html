<br> THE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We don’t do good work. Good work is not enough; we need to do great work.
<br> EDENSPIEKERMANN  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We invent new tools. That may mean throwing out the old toolbox.
<br> THE MANIFESTO &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We need inspiration to inspire. Share your experiences, ideas, failures, successes.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We tolerate failure. Failure is part of the process.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We collaborate. Collaboration does not mean consensus.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We generate ideas. Idea generation is not idea selection.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We like making stuff. Useful, beautiful, important things.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We dare say no. Saying yes is often just laziness.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We like surprises. We have to mistrust our own routines.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It’s your company, too. If something can be done better, don’t wait for permission. </p>
