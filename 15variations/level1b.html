<p>THE EDENSPIEKERMANN MANIFESTO</p>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Edenspiekermann

<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We don’t do good work.
<br> Good work is not enough; we need to do great work.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We invent new tools.
<br> That may mean throwing out the old toolbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We tolerate failure.
<br> Failure is part of the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We collaborate.
<br> Collaboration does not mean consensus.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We generate ideas.
<br> Idea generation is not idea selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We like making stuff.
<br> Useful, beautiful, important things.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We dare say no.
<br> Saying yes is often just laziness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We like surprises.
<br> We have to mistrust our own routines.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s your company, too.
<br> If something can be done better, don’t wait for permission.</p>
