<h1> THE EDENSPIEKERMANN MANIFESTO </h1>

<h2>Edenspiekermann</h2>

<ol>
<li>
We don’t do good work.
<br> Good work is not enough; we need to do great work.
<li>
We invent new tools.
<br> That may mean throwing out the old toolbox.
<li>
We need inspiration to inspire.
<br> Share your experiences, ideas, failures, successes.
<li>
We tolerate failure.
<br> Failure is part of the process.
<li>
We collaborate.
<br> Collaboration does not mean consensus.
</li>
<li>
We generate ideas.
<br> Idea generation is not idea selection.
<li>
We like making stuff.
<br> Useful, beautiful, important things.
<li>
We dare say no.
<br> Saying yes is often just laziness.
<li>
We like surprises.
<br> We have to mistrust our own routines.
<li>
It’s your company, too.
<br> If something can be done better, don’t wait for permission.

</li>
</ol>
